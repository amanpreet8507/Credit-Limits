This C++ Program determines whether a department-store customer has exceeded the credit limit on a change account. For each customer, the following facts are available:
Account number(an interger),
Balance at the beginnin of the month,
Total of all items charged by this customer this month,
Total of all credit applied to this customer's account this month,
Allowed credit limit.
This program uses a while statement to input each of these facts, calculate the new balance (=beginning balance + charges - credits)
and determine whether the new balance exceeds the customer's credit limit.
For those customers whose credit limit is exceeded, the program displays the customer's account number, credit limit, new balance and the message "Credit Limit Exceeded."
